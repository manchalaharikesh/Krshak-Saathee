Problem Explanation:

We grew up watching the scenarios like farmers were unable to get fair prices to their crops. 
This is due to the production of crop more than the demand. When farmers won't get good benefits from their earlier crops they switch the crop in next crop years. 
This causes a shortage of that crop in the upcoming years and prices for that crop will rise eventually. 

Due to the repeated occurence of such scenarios as described above, we could see sudden, huge rise and fall in the same crop price in consecutive years.
-> THIS IS DUE TO THE COMMUNICATION IMBALANCE AMONG THE FARMERS AND THE GOVERNMENT.

Believed Solution:

Crop Statistics:

-> Our Aim is to solve the problem of communication imbalance among farmers.
-> Our main aspect of this project is to create a real-time bar graph for crop yield.
-> With the data obtained from farmers registration on thier district, crop name and area of cultivation we calculate the crop yield.
-> With this data we plot a bar graph for that crop. We also plot a threshold line which is the demand or required production for that crop in the current year.
-> This enables the other farmers to make their decision to grow that crop or not accordingly.
-> So, the upcoming farmers can make a decision of growing the crop by comparing their calculated yield estimations and bar graph.
-> By this we are ensuring that production of crop is in a good relation with the demand of operational year.
-> This makes a communication balance between farmers to produce crops in accordance to demand and procure good benefits.

Other Works:

-> crop yield estimation estimates the crop yield and price to help the farmer in making the decision.
-> We also worked on helping farmers to make a decision on the crop, they have to grow by enabling them to predict their crop's yield.
-> We also worked on giving suitabe crop and fertilizer recommendation.
